## Overview

This repository contains the full set of materials associated with the PhD thesis: _Senescent Mortality: Estimates for Populations and Individuals_ submitted to the University of Southern Denmark on 30 September 2025.

The thesis develops a statistical and demographic framework to estimate senescent mortality, characterize mortality at extreme ages, and separate the timing and pace of human aging.

It combines competing-risks models, mixture formulations of classical mortality laws, penalized likelihood methods, Bayesian estimation, and machine-learning tools.

This repository provides replication materials, including:
- code for all analyses and simulations
- scripts for model estimation
- replication instructions for each chapter/paper
- 	figures and tables
- the thesis PDF itself
- guidance on accessing HMD/HFD data

The aim is to ensure full transparency and reproducibility.
